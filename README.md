### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer, passionate about learning, data analysis and finance. My expertise lies in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am currently learning and gaining experience on building responsive and user-friendly web pages. I like making clear and easy to use sites and apps, and delivering a simple and joyful experience to the end user. 

I'm super used to working in teams, and had acquired great teamwork skills. My knowledge on Git and version control is really helpful to develop and maintain code, also keeping teamwork efforts simple and efficient.

I find joy in learning and growing new skills. On this path, I found out that collaboration is the best (and fastest) approach to incorporate useful knowledge to my skillset and bring value to the different projects I work on.

If you're looking for a team player that likes challenges, rock music and cats: you found it.

Let's connect. Let's build something great together.
